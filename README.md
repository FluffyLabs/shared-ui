## Usage

### Basic Import

```tsx
import { AppsSidebar } from "@fluffylabs/shared-ui";
```

### Importing Styles

Use the precompiled styles in your app:

```tsx
// main.tsx or App.tsx
import "./tailwind.css";
import "@fluffylabs/shared-ui/style.css";
```

And also theme variables:

```css
/* tailwind.css */
@import "tailwind";
@import "@fluffylabs/shared-ui/theme.css";
```

### Tailwind Configuration

To prevent class duplication when using Tailwind CSS in your project, add the shared-ui dist folder to your Tailwind content paths:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "../node_modules/@fluffylabs/shared-ui/dist/**/*.js"],
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { AppsSidebar } from "@fluffylabs/shared-ui";
import "@fluffylabs/shared-ui/style.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <AppsSidebar />
      {/* Your app content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

### Releasing a New Version

The release process involves three steps:

#### Step 1: Create a Version Bump PR

1. Go to [Actions → Release step 1 - Bump version and create PR](../../actions/workflows/shared-ui-bump-version-and-create-pr.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - **Branch**: `main` (releases should always be from main)
   - **Version bump type**: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
4. The workflow will create a pull request with the version bump
5. Review and merge the PR

#### Step 2: Create GitHub Release

After merging the version bump PR:

1. Go to [Actions → Release step 2 - create Github Release](../../actions/workflows/shared-ui-create-release.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. The workflow will:
   - Create a git tag for the new version
   - Create a GitHub release (as draft) with commit history
   - The release includes installation instructions and changes

#### Step 3: Publish to NPM

Once a GitHub release is published (not draft), the [Release step 3 - Publish to NPM](.github/workflows/shared-ui-npm-publish.yml) workflow automatically:

- Checks out the exact tag from the release
- Verifies the tag matches the package.json version
- Builds the component library
- Publishes the package to NPM registry

The publish workflow ensures you're always publishing the exact code that was tagged and released.

### Storybook Deployment

The Storybook is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages and available at:
http://fluffylabs.dev/shared-ui/
