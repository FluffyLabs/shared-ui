## Usage

### Basic Import

```tsx
import { AppsSidebar } from "@fluffylabs/shared-ui";
```

### Importing Styles

Use the precompiled styles in your app:

```tsx
// main.tsx or App.tsx
import "@fluffylabs/shared-ui/style.css";
```

### Tailwind Configuration

To prevent class duplication when using Tailwind CSS in your project, add the shared-ui dist folder to your Tailwind content paths:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "../node_modules/@fluffylabs/shared-ui/dist/**/*.js"],
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { AppsSidebar } from "@fluffylabs/shared-ui";
import "@fluffylabs/shared-ui/style.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <AppsSidebar />
      {/* Your app content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

### Releasing a New Version

Releases are managed through the [Release Workflow](.github/workflows/shared-ui-release.yml):

1. Go to [Actions â†’ Bump Version and Release](../../actions/workflows/shared-ui-release.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - **Branch**: `main` (releases should always be from main)
   - **Version bump type**: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
   - **Dry run**: `true` by default (preview changes without creating a release)
4. Review the dry run results in the workflow summary
5. If everything looks good, run again with **Dry run**: `false`

The workflow will:

- Bump the version in package.json
- Create a git tag
- Generate a GitHub release with commit history
- Automatically trigger the NPM publish workflow

### NPM Publishing

Once a release is created, the [Publish Workflow](.github/workflows/shared-ui-publish.yml) automatically:

- Builds the component library
- Publishes the package to NPM registry

### Storybook Deployment

The Storybook is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages and available at:
http://fluffylabs.dev/shared-ui/
